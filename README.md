# Allure Docker Deploy

![Deployment](https://github.com/cybersokari/allure-docker-deploy/actions/workflows/deploy.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

**Allure Docker Deploy** is a lightweight Docker image designed for testers who want to store and share their Allure test reports in the cloud. With minimal setup, this image enables local test results to be uploaded to a cloud storage bucket, generate a hosted Allure report, and share it via a Firebase-hosted website.

---

## Key Features
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Save Allure test results and history in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Auto generate and host Allure reports on a website for easy sharing with stakeholders.
- **TTL-Optimized Deployment**: Configurable delay before deployment to ensure all test results are finalized.

---

## Requirements
1. **Google Cloud Credentials**:
    - Set up a [Google Cloud service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments) with access to your storage bucket and Firebase Hosting.
    - Download the `service-account-file.json` JSON file that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env will point to.

2. **Google Cloud Storage Bucket**:
    - A storage bucket to store test results and reports.

3. **Firebase Hosting Site**:
    - A configured Firebase Hosting site (default or custom).

## Environment Variables

| Variable                     | Description                                                                 | Default          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | Path to the GCP service account JSON file (required).                   | None             |
| `STORAGE_BUCKET`             | Google Cloud Storage bucket name (required if using cloud storage).         | None             |
| `FIREBASE_SITE_ID`           | Firebase Hosting site ID (required if using Firebase Hosting).              | None             |
| `TTL_SECS`                   | Time to wait (in seconds) before generating and uploading the report.       | 45               |

**Note**: `STORAGE_BUCKET` or `FIREBASE_SITE_ID` must be provided. Both can be configured if you want to enable all functionalities.

## How It Works

1. Mount your test results directory (`/allure-results`) to the container.
2. Configure required environment variables:
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to your GCP credentials file.
   - `STORAGE_BUCKET`: The name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket (if using cloud storage).
   - `FIREBASE_SITE_ID`: Custom Firebase Hosting site ID (if using Firebase Hosting).
3. Optionally, configure:
   - `TTL_SECS`: Delay in seconds before generating and uploading the report (default: 45 seconds).
4. The container will watch for updates in the `/allure-results` directory. Once no new files are detected within the `TTL_SECS` timeframe, it will:
   - Upload results to the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket (if `STORAGE_BUCKET` is provided).
   - Host the generated Allure report on Firebase Hosting (if `FIREBASE_SITE_ID` is provided).
   - Perform both actions if both environment variables are set.
5. [Report history and retries](https://allurereport.org/docs/history-and-retries/#history-and-retries) are auto enabled as `allure-report/history` directory is saved in storage after report generation.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image
```bash
docker pull sokari/allure-docker-deploy:latest
```

### Step 2: Run the Container
```shell
docker run -d \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/credentials/gcp-key.json \
  -e STORAGE_BUCKET=my-test-results-bucket \
  -e TTL_SECS=60 \
  -e FIREBASE_SITE_ID=my-custom-site-id \
  -v /path/to/allure-results:/allure-results \
  -v /path/to/gcp-key.json:/credentials/gcp-key.json \
  sokari/allure-docker-deploy
```
Docker compose example:
```yaml
services:  
  allure:
    image: sokari/allure-docker-deploy
    container_name: deploy-service
    volumes:
      - /path/to/allure-results:/allure-results
      - /path/to/service-account.json:/service-account.json
    environment:
      GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /service-account.json
      STORAGE_BUCKET: your-storage-bucket
      # Uncomment the line below to enable Firebase Hosting
      # FIREBASE_SITE_ID: your-firebase-site-id
      TTL_SECS: 60
```

### Step 3: View the Hosted Report

After the report is generated, the URL to your hosted report will be output in the logs. Share it with your team!
You can also use `<FIREBASE_SITE_ID>.web.app`, which is the [default URL generated by Firebase.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/test-preview-deploy#view-changes)

Example Use Case

	1.	Run your tests locally.
	2.	Output test results to /allure-results.
	3.	The container detects updates and uploads results to Google Cloud Storage.
	4.	Once the test run is complete, an Allure report is generated and hosted on Firebase.
	5.	Share the report URL with stakeholders for review.

Logs and Debugging

View container logs:

```shell
docker logs <your-container-id>
